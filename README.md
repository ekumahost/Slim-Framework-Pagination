# Simple SlimFrameWork Pagination with Twig & Eloquent


## Usage
The script was cut out from slimFramework project so it can only be used by those that codes: 
1. slim Framework 
2. Twig Template engine
3. Eloquent ORM
---Direct simple pagination without headache configurations.

#Little Into
In index.twig a css class provided renders the pagination in a very sweet manner.
Because this script is provided for experts, much explanation will not be given.
Route into the index method in index.php, passing a url query "pageId" returns the data for the page specified.
The script is well commented, so if you use SLIM, TWIG AND ELOQUENT you should not ask any question after opening it.
It is not something you can want to pull in via composer, its just more like tutorial script. 
you can also apply your own css to the .pagination div.
